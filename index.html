        <p>
          I’m a <span class="accent">Project Manager, Community Manager, Social Media Manager, Moderator and Ambassador</span>.
          My work is simple to explain, but powerful when done right: I make sure creators and communities
          can actually work together.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, a good community isn’t just a chat full of messages — it’s a space where people feel safe,
          heard, and excited to come back. A place where information is clear, rules are fair, and projects
          grow in a way that makes sense for everyone involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pay attention to people, patterns and energy: what they ask, what they keep repeating,
          what they’re worried about, and what makes them stay. I bring that feedback back to the teams,
          so projects can make better decisions based on real community signals.

          <h3>Project Manager</h3>
          <p>
            As a Project Manager, I coordinate between the team and the community.
            I help structure updates, keep everyone aligned, and make sure important
            information is clear and easy to find.
          </p>
          <p>
            My focus is on clarity, planning and follow-through, so projects can move
            forward in a way that feels organized and trustworthy for both builders and holders.

          <h3>Community Manager</h3>
          <p>
            As a Community Manager, I make sure everyone feels welcome and included.
            I answer questions, help people connect, and keep conversations positive.
            I want the community to be a place people enjoy being in — not just something
            they scroll past once.
          </p>
          <p>
            I listen to what people are saying, notice repeating patterns, and bring that feedback
            back to the team. That way, everyone feels heard and the project actually improves over time.

          <h3>Social Media Manager</h3>
          <p>
            As a Social Media Manager, I handle updates, news and announcements — especially on X.
            I focus on clarity first: people should instantly understand what’s going on and what matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also analyze what works and what doesn’t, so communication becomes sharper over time.
            The goal is simple: keep the audience informed, excited and aligned with the project.

          <h3>Moderator</h3>
          <p>
            As a Moderator, I keep the space running smoothly and safely.
            That means explaining the rules, stepping in when discussions get messy,
            and keeping things fair for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            My job isn’t to boss people around — it’s to protect the community.
            I try to see problems before they escalate, so the atmosphere stays positive,
            constructive and aligned with the project’s values.

            As an Ambassador, I work with projects I genuinely care about.
            I help developers and founders share their ideas in a way the community can understand,
            trust and support.
          </p>
          <p>
            I collect feedback, answer questions, and help projects grow in ways that make real sense.
            In short: I’m the bridge between creators and the community, helping ideas turn into
            real, usable experiences.

        <p>
          Real communities don’t survive on hype alone. They need structure, communication and someone who
          cares about both sides: the people building and the people joining.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s my role — to connect those worlds, keep things human, and make growth sustainable.

        <h2>Q&amp;A — Get to Know Me</h2>
        <p>A few questions I often get about my work and my place in Web3.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:6px;">How did you get into crypto/Web3?</h3>
        <p>
          I got into Web3 out of curiosity. I started reading about it, learning how different projects and
          communities work, and exploring the technology behind it. The more I learned, the more I wanted
          to be part of the space and contribute in my own way.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:6px;">What do you enjoy most about being a Community Manager?</h3>
        <p>
          I love talking to people and keeping the space lively. I enjoy making members feel comfortable,
          helping them understand things, and turning a quiet chat into an active one. It feels great
          knowing the community depends on me for energy, guidance, and connection.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:6px;">What skills do you bring to a project/community?</h3>
        <p>
          I bring consistency, organization, and strong communication. I know how to keep people engaged,
          explain things clearly, and maintain a positive atmosphere. I also create content that fits the
          project’s tone, adapt quickly to what’s needed, and make sure the community feels valued and
          supported.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:6px;">Why do you believe in community-driven projects like CBS?</h3>
        <p>
          Because the community is the real backbone of any project. CBS grows because its members care,
          participate, and support each other. When people feel involved and heard, the project becomes
          more than just a token — it becomes a shared vision that everyone contributes to.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:6px;">What are your long-term goals in Web3?</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
          I want to keep growing in Web3 and become a leader in the space. I aim to work on big projects,
          help shape communities, and eventually take on roles where I can influence strategy and build
          something meaningful that reaches a wide audience. I want to keep pushing myself, learning, and
          making an impact that goes beyond just one project.
