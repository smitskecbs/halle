      <div class="card card--about">
        <p>
          I’m a <span class="accent">Community Manager, Social Media Manager, Moderator and Ambassador</span>.
          My work is simple to explain, but powerful when done right: I make sure creators and communities
          can actually work together.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, a good community isn’t just a chat full of messages — it’s a space where people feel safe,
          heard, and excited to come back. A place where information is clear, rules are fair, and projects
          grow in a way that makes sense for everyone involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pay attention to people, patterns and energy: what they ask, what they keep repeating,
          what they’re worried about, and what makes them stay. I bring that feedback back to the teams,
          so projects can make better decisions based on real community signals.

          <h3>Community Manager</h3>
          <p>
            As a Community Manager, I make sure everyone feels welcome and included.
            I answer questions, help people connect, and keep conversations positive.
            I want the community to be a place people enjoy being in — not just something
            they scroll past once.
          </p>
          <p>
            I listen to what people are saying, notice repeating patterns, and bring that feedback
            back to the team. That way, everyone feels heard and the project actually improves over time.

          <h3>Social Media Manager</h3>
          <p>
            As a Social Media Manager, I handle updates, news and announcements — especially on X.
            I focus on clarity first: people should instantly understand what’s going on and what matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also analyze what works and what doesn’t, so communication becomes sharper over time.
            The goal is simple: keep the audience informed, excited and aligned with the project.

        <article class="role-card">
          <h3>Moderator</h3>
          <p>
            As a Moderator, I keep the space running smoothly and safely.
            That means explaining the rules, stepping in when discussions get messy,
            and keeping things fair for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            My job isn’t to boss people around — it’s to protect the community.
            I try to see problems before they escalate, so the atmosphere stays positive,
            constructive and aligned with the project’s values.

          <h3>Ambassador</h3>
          <p>
            As an Ambassador, I work with projects I genuinely care about.
            I help developers and founders share their ideas in a way the community can understand,
            trust and support.
          </p>
          <p>
            I collect feedback, answer questions, and help projects grow in ways that make real sense.
            In short: I’m the bridge between creators and the community, helping ideas turn into
            real, usable experiences.

        <h3>Why this matters</h3>
        <p>
          Real communities don’t survive on hype alone. They need structure, communication and someone who
          cares about both sides: the people building and the people joining.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s my role — to connect those worlds, keep things human, and make growth sustainable.
